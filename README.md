# Unit-Converter-Web-App
This is a simple web-based unit converter that allows users to convert.
Length (meters ↔ kilometers, inches ↔ centimeters)
Weight (kilograms ↔ pounds)
Temperature (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactivity.
How It Works:
The user selects a conversion type (Length, Weight, Temperature).
The available units update dynamically.
The user enters a value, selects From and To units.
When the "Convert" button is clicked, the conversion is calculated and displayed.
